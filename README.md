# Ball Bounce!

A fun and interactive ball bouncing game built using Python and Pygame. Control a bouncing ball, avoid obstacles, and score points by bouncing off them. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and the obstacles are randomly placed each time the game starts or the player advances to a new level.

## Features

- **Gravity-based Physics**: The ball bounces around the screen, influenced by gravity.
- **Random Obstacles**: Each level features randomly placed obstacles to keep the game challenging and engaging.
- **Multiple Levels**: Players advance to the next level upon reaching 13 points, with up to three levels of increasing difficulty.
- **Scoring System**: Score points by bouncing off obstacles.
- **Game Over and Restart**: The game ends if the ball hits the bottom of the screen, with an option to restart.
- **Fine Print**: A small text in the bottom right corner credits the game's creator.
